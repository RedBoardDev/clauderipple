 * Bring `~/.claude/settings.json` in line with `cli.models` after a GUI save.

 * these slots are read by Claude Code *before* a request exists, so they live in the env block and
 * nothing else writes them. Without this, choosing a slot on the Clients screen saved a value that
 * did nothing until the next `install`: the screen said DeepSeek while every search, title and
 * subagent went on running on Haiku (found this way, 2026-09-21).
 *
 * The GUI sends an empty string to mean "back to Claude" (`saveModelSlots` records every select,
 * so a slot set back to the default arrives as `""`). That is a key *present* with a falsy value,
 * which `applyProxyEnv` reads as "clear this one" and writes no env entry for — not the same thing
 * as `ANTHROPIC_MODEL: ""`, which would still be a key to Claude Code.
 *
